                  way forward.`,

  alpacaHeadline1: "ALPACA...",
  alpacaHeadline2: "THE NEW CASHMERE",

  alpacaBody1: `Alpaca wool is one of the finest and most luxurious materials 
              in the world.`,

  alpacaBody2: `Although cashmere is more well known, alpaca wool also belongs 
              to a select group of fine and luxurious fibers. Wearing alpaca 
              isn't just fashion statement... it's an experience.`,

  alpacaBody3: `What makes it so unique and special? Alpaca wool is the 
              natural result of the environment of the alpaca's habitat in 
              The Peruvian Andes (over 4000 meters above sea level). Where 
              the icey temperatures live in harmony with sunny days, nature 
              itself has created the perfect wool formula: warm, soft and 
              cozy, combined with the best sun protection and excellent 
              texture. You will be wearing something which back in ancient 
              times was only accessible to kings and queens.`,

  alpacaBody4: `The alpaca comes from the South American Andes, like the 
              llamas and vicuÃ±as.`,

  alpacaBody5: `The domestication of alpacas began about 3,000 years ago in 
              the Andean highlands. During the ancient rule of the Inca 
              Empire, alpaca wool was considered the "fiber of the gods".`,

  alpacaBody6: `Alpacas are intelligent, curious, sensitive and known cautious 
              animals (you could even call them shy). Basically, alpacas are 
              divided into 2 groups: the Suri alpaca (a typical feature of 
              them is their wonderful, soft, curly wool) and the Huacaya
               alpaka (with their consistent fibers). These 2 groups 
               represent the majority of the alpaca population.`,

  alpacaBody7: `Alpacas are social herd animals and require very little pasture 
              land - making them a very environmentally friendly and safe 
              wool producer.`,
